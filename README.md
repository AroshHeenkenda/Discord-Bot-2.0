# Discord-Bot-2.0

#### Discord Bot that I made for fun, main function is to play music however, future version will incorporate more functionality.

## NOTE: 
#### OPENJDK 13.0.2 needs to be installed - https://jdk.java.net/archive/
#### Lavalink needs to be installed - https://ci.fredboat.com/viewLog.html?buildId=lastSuccessful&buildTypeId=Lavalink_Build&tab=artifacts&guest=1#
#### Wavelink 0.9.0 or greater requried
 
## LAUNCHING BOT:
#### As I don't know how to automate the process of hosting a bot on a server I have to follow a particular process.
#### First I must run the Lavalink server off my command window, after which I must run the launcher.py file. Then the bot should initialise and run.
